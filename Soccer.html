            I've been a soccer fan for a long while, probably since 1999, the time when Manchester United won their superior three championships in one year.
            I'm also a big fan of Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea and Byren. I've stop watching games since last few years, because my stars such as David Beckham, Micheal Owen and Zidane all retired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally speaking, I'm not a guy infatuated with offensive strategies. I like hard defense and all strong and skillful deffensive players. I think with the progress of soccer and our athletics, today's players can handle more skills than before, so I don't want to talk more about the old period like Pele, Beckenbauer, Maradona and Matth√§us. 
          </p>

            Like everyone, I have my own all time team. <a href="so-legend.html" target="_blank"> Check the another page to see the legendary in my heart.</a> If you think more of my all time team, you could say I'm a Premier League lover. True, the league has most impressive players and the smartest coaches. As a explorer, Premier League has been a place for several brave mentors to develop new techniques and implement their theories into the games. Soccer's market is quite large, even though there was a contest for teams being commercialized. Consider a senario that Chinese teams spent 100 million dollars to build up the team and buy some top tier players, but they still made profit after a huge fritter.

            By the way, my favorite soccer player is David Beckham when he was a RM at Manchester United. I learned a lot from emulating his remarkable long pass and position feel. Honestly, when I was in college, I tried to play as a RM, however, my speed was not fast enough to fill this role. I actually was a CMF/DMF, sometimes could be a AMF. Someone called me Scholes, somehow.
